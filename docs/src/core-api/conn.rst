Conn
****

A *Conn*, short for "connection", models the entirety of a connection
between the HTTP server and the user agent, both request and response.

.. code-block:: haskell

    type Conn req res components =
      { request :: req
      , response :: res
      , components :: components
      }

The ``request`` and ``response`` hold the values representing the HTTP
request and response, respectively. The purpose of the ``components``
field, however, is not that obvious. It is used for things not directly
related to HTTP, but nonetheless related to the act of responding to the HTTP
request. A middleware can add information to the Conn using components, like
providing authentication or authorization values. The types of these components
then becomes part of the Conn type, and you get stronger static guarantees when
using the middleware.
