NodeJS

The server in ``Hyper.Node.Server`` wraps the ``http`` module in NodeJS,
and serves middleware using the ``Aff`` monad. Here is how you can start
a Node server:

.. code-block:: haskell

    let
      app =
        writeStatus (Tuple 200 "OK")
        :*> closeHeaders
        :*> respond "Hello there!"
    in runServer defaultOptions {} app

As seen above, ``runServer`` takes a record of options, an initial
*components* record, and your application middleware. If you want to do
logging on server startup, and on any request handling errors, use
``defaultOptionsWithLogging``.

Monad Transformers
==================

You might want to use a monad transformer stack in your application, for
instance as a way to pass configuration, or to accumulate some state in
the chain of middleware. The underlying monad of ``Middleware`` is
parameterized for this exact purpose. When running the NodeJS server
with monad transformers, you need to use ``runServer'`` instead of the regular
``runServer``, and pass a function that runs your monad and returns an ``Aff``
value.

The following code runs a middleware using the ``ReaderT`` monad
transformer. Note that the ``runAppM`` function might need to be defined
at the top-level to please the type checker.

.. literalinclude:: NodeReaderT.purs
   :language: haskell
   :start-after: start snippet main
   :end-before: end snippet main

In a real-world application the configuration type ``MyConfig`` could
hold a database connection pool, or settings read from the environment,
for example.
